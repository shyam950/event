What is event management?</h2>

          <p><center>Event management is the process of creating and maintaining an event. This process spans from the very beginning of planning all the way to post-event strategizing.</center></p></div>
        <div class="col"><h5>EVENT MANAGEMENT IS EVENT PLANNING</h5>
          <p><center>All different branches of planning go into event management, including various types of sourcing, designing, regulation checks, and on-site management. In event management, you could be in the process of creating a conference, a product launch, an internal sales kick-off, or even a wedding. Really, any event that requires considerable planning and execution is event management.
Event management goes by many different names. Some event planners are called administrative assistants, some are called event coordinators, and others are called event technologists. What do all of these titles have in common? The individuals have some hand in planning an event. Whether the events are internal or external, large or small, in-person or virtual, they all have to be planned.
